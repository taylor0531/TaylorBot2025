Swerve code for FRC 2025.
This code is base swerve code with pathplanner in autonomous. 

We are experiencing issues with drive distance during autonomous. We consistantly drive close to 68% of the distance set in pathplanner.
We've had many people review our code & pathplanner settings and we're unable to find the cause of the '68%'.

We appreciate any suggestions on how we can fix this issue.
